## Description
Case Study deliverable submitted as the final project for DS 4002. Authored by Carson Crenshaw. 

What determines a good life? In a society that is increasingly driven by money and power, happiness and quality of life have the potential to be overlooked and under prioritized. Happiness, however, is a powerful tool that can be used to optimize the well-being of whole populations. Acknowledging this, the General Assembly of the [United Nations began publishing](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/foreword/) the annual World Happiness Report. This report reviews the current state of happiness in the world and illustrates national variations in happiness for a given year. Ultimately, the research reflects an international demand for a greater understanding of happiness. 

As a bright new U.N. intern tasked with studying international development, you have the potential to help determine which issues should be prioritized in future U.N. programs. You believe that peopleâ€™s overall wellbeing is the ultimate good and that the international community should center itself around this goal. World Happiness scores can and should be employed to strengthen societies and achieve better standards of living. As happiness is increasingly considered an important measurement of national progress, you are tasked with examining the relationship between World Happiness scores and life evaluation factors. By figuring out the relative importance of different domains in shaping happiness, you will be able to provide evidence-based guidance for your policymaking supervisors on how to achieve a stronger social fabric and better public welfare.
